Includes generator (in Ruby). In pixels, increment 2px.

## How to use

**With npm**

`git clone https://github.com/TheoryForce/PadMar.git`

**Or simply...**

The library can be found in the `dist` directory. You can link it in your template like any other CSS file.

In case you wanted to have the CSS classes by an increment different than 2px or in a range different than 0px - 200px, you can look at the generator in the `generator` directory. It's just a Ruby loop.
